SDE Project

The core of the project is in TheFitnessGuru folder.

There is also the ExtraFeature folder which contains an additional service for sending emails.

The Database folder contains commands to initialize the database and a test script.
We used the remote database db4free.net in the code but in the provided virtual machine (VirtualMachine folder) this was replaced with a local database.
