# SDEProject
The core of the project is in TheFitnessGuru folder.

There is also the ExtraFeature folder which contains an additional service for sending emails.

The Database folder contains commands to initialize the database and a test script.
We used the remote database db4free.net in the code but in the provided virtual machine (VirtualMachine folder) this was replaced with a local database.

# Demo
To start the project in the provided Virtual Machine we recommend that you start Intellij IDEA and initially open the ExtraFeature project and run it. It should automatically open the web browser on port 8081 and show the words "ExtraFeature Working". 
Having done that, open with Intellij IDEA the TheFitnessGuru project (leaving ExtraFeature running) and run it as well. The login form should appear shortly.
The database should start automatically at startup so it does not need to be started as well.

There are 3 main users already entered in the db:
- User Athlete {username: stefanotrick - password: stefanotrick}
- User Nutritionist {username: giovannirigotti - password: giovannirigotti}
- User Trainer {username: fededalmo- password: fededalmo}
